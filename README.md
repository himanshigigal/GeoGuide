# GeoGuide: Autonomous Event-Responsive Robotic System

GeoGuide is an autonomous robotic system designed to detect and respond to critical events in simulated war zone environments. It leverages image processing and machine learning to identify high-priority events from overhead images and navigates dynamically to those locations using optimal path planning algorithms.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Design and develop a robotic system capable of:
- Detecting war zone events like fires, destroyed buildings, and aid zones
- Prioritizing events based on urgency
- Planning optimal paths through the environment
- Navigating autonomously to the event location
- Providing real-time geo-tracking on a digital map

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Image Capture**: Overhead camera captures the map with events marked.
2. **Event Detection**: Image is processed; a ResNet-based CNN identifies and classifies events.
3. **Path Planning**: Based on event priority, the shortest path is computed.
4. **Navigation**: The robot follows black lines on a white map using IR sensors.
5. **Execution**: Bot moves autonomously to the high-priority event location.
